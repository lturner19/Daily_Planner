# Day Planner

## Introduction
 In this modern life of juggling multiple professional commitments, organization is key. A weekday scheduler is the perfect way to have a quick and focused view of the days' assignments, deadlines, meetings, etc.  

 Although this scheduler is currently setup for professional use, it could easily be modified to accommodate personal tasks outside of work hours.


## Details

1. The scheduler has the ability to keep up with the current date and time.
    * The present hour is a blush color
    * Any previous time is colored gray
    * Any future time is colored turquoise
                  <br></br> 

2. The user can then save their tasks by clicking the save icon on the right side of the row.
    * The user's tasks will still be there upon returning to the site.
